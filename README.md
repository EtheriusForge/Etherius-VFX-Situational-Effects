Etherius's VFX: Situational Effects

A lightweight visual enhancement module for Foundry VTT (v13+) designed to provide immersive feedback during combat events.
Features

    Downed VFX: Triggers a vignette and blood splatter overlay when a character reaches 0 HP.

    Synchronized Display: Optional setting to also see visual effects when any party member is downed. Can be toggled individually per the player's preference.

    Customization: Complete control over vignette colors, blood tinting, fade durations, and screen-shake intensity. Default is suitable for most characters (red blood).

    Live Preview: Integrated test functionality within the settings menu to preview effects.

Installation & Usage

    Navigate to Configure Settings -> Etherius's VFX: Situational Effects.

    Adjust visual parameters (colors, duration, shake) to your preference.

    Save then use the Test button to verify the configuration.

    Save changes to apply the settings to your game session.

Future Development

This module is actively maintained. Planned future enhancements include:

    Token-Level Feedback: Smaller, localized visual effects centered on character tokens when they receive healing or take damage.

    Status Overlays: Effects for conditions like Poisoned or Frightened.

    Damage Type VFX: Visual overlays and effects tailored to the specific type of damage inflicted (e.g., frost, fire, or necrotic).
